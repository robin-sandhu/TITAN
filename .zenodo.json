  "title": "TITAN: A Standardized Framework for Clinical Prediction Model Development",
  "description": "TITAN is a human-in-the-loop copilot for developing well-calibrated clinical prediction models. Unlike AutoML tools that chase AUC, TITAN enforces calibration at every step—because if your model says 30% risk, it should actually mean 30% risk in practice. Core features include Random Forest with calibration, MICE imputation, EPV guardrails, bootstrap confidence intervals, SHAP explainability, fairness auditing, decision curve analysis, and immutable audit logs.",
